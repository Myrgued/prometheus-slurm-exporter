# Development

You must have access to a slurm head node running `slurmrestd` and a valid token
for that service. Take note of your slurm version, such as `24.05`, as you'll
use this version when building.

## Requirements

Install Go from source if you don't already have it.

```bash
export VERSION=1.22.5 OS=linux ARCH=amd64
wget https://dl.google.com/go/go$VERSION.$OS-$ARCH.tar.gz
tar -xzvf go$VERSION.$OS-$ARCH.tar.gz
export PATH=$PWD/go/bin:$PATH
```

_Alternatively install Go using the packaging system of your Linux
distribution._

## Building

### Clone this repository and build

Use Git to clone the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Myrgued/prometheus-slurm-exporter.git
cd prometheus-slurm-exporter
```

Build the binary for your SLURM version, for example 24.05:

```bash
SLURM_VERSION=24.05 make
```

Run tests for a specific SLURM version:

```bash
SLURM_VERSION=24.05 make test
```

Run the tests for all SLURM versions:

```bash
SLURM_VERSION=all make test
```

Start the exporter:

```bash
./bin/prometheus-slurm-exporter
```

If you wish to run the exporter on a different port, or the default port (8080)
is already in use, run with the following argument:

```bash
./bin/prometheus-slurm-exporter --listen-address="0.0.0.0:<port>"
```

Query all metrics:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics
```

### Cutting releases

Once you're ready to cut a new release, perform the following steps on the
`main` branch.

Tag the release version:

`git tag v1.0.1`

Push the tag:

`git push origin v1.0.1`

Make sure you have `GITHUB_TOKEN` exported, then use `goreleaser` to create
releases:

`goreleaser release --clean`

## Adding Support for New Openapi Versions

### Install openapi-generator-cli and openjdk

Install `openapi-generator-cli` globally with NPM:

```bash
npm install -g @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli`
```

This package depends on having the `java` executable in `PATH`, so install java.

For mac, `brew install java`, then following the brew message, symlink the JDK,
`sudo ln -sfn /usr/local/opt/openjdk/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk.jdk`

For ubuntu, `sudo snap install openjdk`.

### Generating and Saving Openapi specs from SLURM using Docker

Navigate to the `docker` directory and use the python script to automatically
grab and store an openapi yaml spec from a target slurm version into the
`openapi-specs` directory.

```bash
python build_slurm_version.py 24.11
```

### Generating the Openapi code for new SLURM versions

I do this for every new SLURM version, so it should already be done.

Assuming 23.11:

```bash
openapi-generator-cli generate \
    -g go \
    -i openapi-specs/23.11.json \
    -o ../openapi-slurm-23-11 \
    --package-name openapi_slurm_23_11 \
    --git-user-id Myrgued \
    --git-repo-id openapi-slurm-23-11
```

This will generate an entire git repository that you can toss up in GitHub.
